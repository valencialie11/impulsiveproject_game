# Impulsive Game using Python and Arcade package

## Dependencies
- Arcade
- OS
- Math

During this quarantine, I was determined to make use of my time wisely and productively by making use of my beginner Python skills. I came across this website https://opensource.com/article/18/4/easy-2d-game-creation-python-and-arcade which inspired this whole making of games.
I am still a beginner in Python so I made sure to look at the documentation and analyse them carefully before modifying it to suit this game I want to build. The game designs are dedicated to my boyfriend, who is currently in the Army, because he believed in me from day 1. 
This is definitely not a finished project because there's still so many things to modify and change, however, as of now, I'm satisfied at how it turns out!
I will probably modify this some other time in the future because I'm too eager to start on another project (yes, I'm impulsive like that)

Anyway, do look through the website that I quoted above because it is such a comprehensive guide for beginners to start making their dream games! See you~
